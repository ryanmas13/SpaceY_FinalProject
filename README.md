This is the final capstone project for the IBM Specialization on Coursera. 
Each step of the project has been marked with a suffix in the file name e.g. 1, 2, 3 etc. to demonstrate the order in which the files can be executed. 
There are 2 files for the Dash app viz. 7 and 7a. You can use either of them. 
CSV files serve as interim inputs to various files. These have been mentioned in comments. 
A compandion PDF has been uploaded summarizing this project and its objectives.
